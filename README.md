## 01 Research Question
#### For the purpose of this project, I chose to answer the question, "are bike boulevards equitable?" through an analytical safety lens. The following analysis uses bike and pedestrian collision data to understand how collision density varies along Berkeley's bike boulevard network. Bike boulevards are often lauded by planners as safe and comfortable facilities for all ages and abilities. However, given the historical disadvantegment of West Berkeley and the lack of robust intersection improvement recommendations in Berkeley's 2017 Bicycle Master Plan, my hypothesis is that some segments of the bike boulevard network are more safe than others.  

## 02 Data
#### Bike network data from the Berkeley Bicycle Plan Update (in-progress, expected in 2023 but plan is delayed) // shapefile <img width="251" alt="Picture2" src="https://github.com/lisa-schroer/cp255-final-project/assets/157168522/b7c0c183-cd41-4537-8500-d4b03d0fc389">
#### Collision data from UC Berkeley TIMS over a 5-year period from January 2018 to December 2022 // csv
